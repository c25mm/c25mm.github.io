You're always there. <br>
You're the one who always has my interests in mind, no matter how fast you're moving. <br>
You're loving and caring while being saavy and intelligent. <br>
You're one of the two people I would trust the most. <br>
And while it might not seem like I always agree with you or do what you want me to immediately, <br>
I appreciate everything you do because it is all to help the ones you love most, which is something that I want to extend in my life. <br>

	LOVE, <br>
	<p>Maxwell Stanley Massiah</p>
