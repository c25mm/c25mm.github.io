<h3>Journal Entry #1: 10/3/21<h3>

<h1>What have you learned so far, specifically in CS1? How are you feeling about it? What are you working on? What are you excited about or frustrated by? What are your goals for the next week or two?</h1>

So far in CS1, I have learned that there are different types of languages in code and how some of them are different. I have also learned how organization is important in coding. At times, I feel very confident in changing my code but at other moments I do not feel very confident and sometimes get stuck. That sometimes gets me frustrated, especially when I am stuck for quite a bit of time. I am excited about the potential of code. Originally, I thought I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do but just after my first few codesketches, I can see how the possibilities are virtually limitless. My goals for the next week or two are to complete the foundation my first thorough project and put in a hyperlink in the projects section that isn't codesketch2.
