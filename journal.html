<h3>Journal Entry #1: 10/3/21<h3>

<h1>What have you learned so far, specifically in CS1? How are you feeling about it? What are you working on? What are you excited about or frustrated by? What are your goals for the next week or two?

So far in CS1, I have learned that there are different types of languages in code and how some of them are different. I have also learned how organization is important in coding. At times, I feel very confident in changing my code but at other moments I do not feel very confident and sometimes get stuck. That sometimes gets me frustrated, especially when I am stuck for quite a bit of time. I am excited about the potential of code. Originally, I thought I had a clear idea of what I wanted to do but just after my first few codesketches, I can see how the possibilities are virtually limitless. My goals for the next week or two are to complete the foundation my first thorough project and put in a hyperlink in the projects section that isn't codesketch2.</h1>

<h3>Journal Entry #2: </h3>



<h1>Some new things that I have done for my website are I have made a lot of headway on my second project for the website that is a birthday card for my mom. I think that I added all the components that I wanted to, I am just not sure if I added them in the ways I wanted to. One thing I learned in that process was how to create a background image for a whole page. The second thing I have done is created the theme for my website. I think I will make my website about youtube and certain youtubers. I was inspired by Gus's website from 2020 and I think I want to do something where you click and then certain images appear and I think I want to do that with youtubers. </h1>

<h3>Journal Entry #3: 10/21/21</h3>

<h1>
Some new things I have made this week have been adding/creating my mom's birthday card and creating my first CSS animation. I made it because I forgot a birthday present for my mom and also I wanted to make something myself for her. For the CSS animation, I wanted to create one of the projects that fell into the theme of my website. I feel that I wasn't able to do exactly what I wanted for both, but I have a pretty good foundation and only want to add certain accessories. I'm frustrated that I can't get the javascript to work, as well as that I can't get multiple images to show up for my CSS animation. I've learned a bit of how Javascript works.</h1>


<h3>Journal Entry #4: 10/31/21</h3>

<h1>

In javascript, a variable is just something you equate to something you want to happen. For example, in my code, the variable "smile" leads to "document.getElementbyID". It's like a shortcut of writing something like in math where x could equal anything, but shortening it to x just helps someone understand it/organize their math better. A function is just an action you want to get done in javascript. You make a function run using parentheses, then curly brackets, and a semicolon to end it all. You also have to actually make something happen by using language like "document.getElementById" or smile.addEventListener. The words I've learned in javascript so far are Element, console, log, and function (in a computer science context). I use my function to change text within an image, as well as rotate an image. </h1>

<h3>Journal Entry #5: 11/11/21 (CW)</h3>
<h1>First, you have to label the function (called makeCookie) and put parentheses and curly brackets (input and output). Then, you give what you want to do a shortcut name (in this case it's cookie) and then place a div or just something in the body of the page. Then you give the size of the something you want to put in the body of the page. Then you tell the code what the something is (as an image in the folder). Then you use the shortcut to create another function so when you call on the shortcut, you create a function that listens for a click and then changes the image. Now, you have the recipe and you just make it run by repeating its name.</h1>
<h3>Journal Entry #6: 11/11/21 (HW)</h3>
<h1>Something I am working on is for my second javascript function trying tto place an image on an embedded audio. Something that I learned from the articles is the concept of true/false in javascript and the difference between an equality and an assignment.</h1>
